### Deployment

SecretLinks requires you to secure access to the /api route with a reverse proxy.
An example deployment could be as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    SECRETLINKS(SecretLinks);
    INTERNAL(Other internal systems);
    USERS(["Users ðŸ‘¥"]);
    PROXY("<b>Reverse Proxy ðŸ›ƒ</b>
      - prohibits access to <samp>/api</samp>
      - handles TLS encryption
    ");
    style INTERNAL stroke,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    subgraph Secured network
      direction RL
      INTERNAL-- push secrets -->SECRETLINKS;
      PROXY-->SECRETLINKS;
    end
    USERS-- view secrets -->PROXY;
```
